# United Nations Resolutions Archive by Khalil Samoud and Chase Duvall

This is the front-end part of our project UN Resolutions for CS396-Web Development. 

## Current State

We have a working interface with links to resolutions and countries. The countries page has countries listed alphabetically. Once you click on a country you can have a list of resolutions that can be sorted by year. Similarly the resolutions page has a number of resolutions where you can see the details of resolutions and the votes. 

## What we used for this part

We retrieve information using a backend server that runs locally for now. 
We are using React for routing, handling events.. 

## Next Steps

Improve the UI/UX of the website, both stylistically and by adding menu options for sorting resolutions by page number/category.
Possibly: Click to load more for infinite scroll.
Fix bugs, improve loading. 
Add interactive maps and statistics in the resolution and home page .
Deploy the website to Heroku.
